     * Amazon ships millions of packages every day. A large percentage of them are fulfilled by. Amazon, so it is important to minimize shipping costs. It has been found that moving a group of 3 packages to the shipping facility together is most efficient. The shipping process needs to be optimized at a new warehouse. There are the following types of queries or requests:
     * INSERT package id: insert package id in the queue of packages to be shipped
     * SHIP-: ship the group of 3 items that were in the queue earliest i.e. they are returned in the order they entered,
     * Perform q queries and return a list of lists, one for every SHIP - type query. The lists are
     * either; 3 package ID strings in the order they were queued. Or, if there are not enough packages in the queue to fulfill the query, the result is I"N/A"J.
     * Note:
     * •: Initially, the queue is empty.
     * •. The list of packages shipped per group should be in the order they were queued.
     * The function performQueries take List<List<>> of type String as a parameter which contains each query where
     * list.get(i).get(0) = INSERT | SHIP
     * list.get(i).get(1) = shipmentID | -
     * Example Test Case:
     * 5
     * 2
     * INSERT GT23513413
     * INSERT TQC2451340
     * SHIP -
     * INSERT VYP8561991
     * SHIP
     * Expected result:
     * [N/A]
     * [GT23513413, TQC2451340, VYP8561991]
