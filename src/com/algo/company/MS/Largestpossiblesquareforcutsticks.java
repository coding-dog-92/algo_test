     *There are two wooden sticks of lengths A and B respectively. Each of them can be cut
     * into shorter sticks of integer lengths. Our goal is to construct the largest possible
     * square. In order to do this, we want to cut the sticks in such a way as to achieve four
     * sticks of the same length (note that there can be some leftover pieces). What is the
     * longest side of square that we can achieve?
     * Write a function:
     * def solution(A, B)
     * that, given two integers A, B, returns the side length of the largest square that we can
     * obtain. If it is not possible to create any square, the function should return 0.
     * Examples:
     * 1. Given A = 10, B = 21, the function should return 7. We can split the second stick into
     * three sticks of length 7 and shorten the first stick by 3.
     * 2. Given A = 13, B = 11, the function should return 5. We can cut two sticks of length 5
     * from each of the given sticks.
     * 3. Given A = 2, B = 1, the function should return 0. It is not possible to make any square
     * from the given sticks.
     * 4. Given A = 1, B = 8, the function should return 2. We can cut stick B into four parts.
